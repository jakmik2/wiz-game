# Pitch
You are a wizard, wandering. You've got your deck of tricks. Besting others results in victory. Sometimes, victory is hard.

Luckily wizards dictate fate.

## Game loop
Wander the land and interact with npcs. NPCs engage in trade or battle, often both.

### Battle
Decks are simple, you must get a higher match their assets (red, green, blue) to beat them, first to match their assets wins.

Some cards are assets, some cards allow you to play assets, some cards impact your opponents cards

Turns go:
- Draw
- Play
- Cheeat????

You draw one card per round.

You play one card (barring effects)

You end your turn (barring effects)

#### Cheating
Cheating is a special magical act that only wizards can do, you burn a card (eithe in your hand or in your deck) and you may perform some cheat action:
 - Play an extra card
 - Draw an extra card
 - Skip opponents turn
 - Etc
 
Each NPC has a threshold for their tolerance to cheating. Cheat too many times and they may become aggrivated, aggivated players attack you directly and when you're out of health, you die.

#### Victory
Victory occurs when achieving the NPC's asset count. Upon victory, they will offer you a their most special card, they'll only do this once.

#### Defeat
If the opponent achieves the asset count before you do, they win, they may flaunt their victory, they may not. Either way, you're free to challenge them in the future
